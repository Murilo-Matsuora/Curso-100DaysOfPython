<h1>The best movies ever</h1>
<h2>The top 3 movies according to Murilo</h2>

<hr>

<h3>1. Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse</h3>
<p>Amazing animations with incredible story. One of the best adaptations of superheroes to the big screen</p>

<h3>2. Cars</h3>
<p>This is a personal pick as, though it's a great movie overall, it wouldn't be on most people's favorite picks. Still, it holds a big sentimental value to me, since it was my first ever obsession.</p>

<h3>3. Knives out</h3>
<p>I've started to develop a liking for detective movies, and this is a great textbook example of it.</p>

<h4>HM. Memento</h4>
<p>Interesting and thoughtfull, hard to understand at first, but with such a great twist when you finally get it.</p>
